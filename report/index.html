        <h1>Report on web development progress</h1>
        <h3>Student</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name: </strong>Yosef Shulman</li>
            <li><strong>Number: </strong>220306410 </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The website I have developed serves as a hub for local cybersecurity professionals to share insights and
                stay updated on the latest industry trends. The essential ideas are knowledge exchange, skill
                enhancement, and community building. The chosen structure is centered around user's research,
                professional
                opinions, and how-to guides for industry professionals.
                I intentionally did not use any frameworks or libraries, besides small dependency for initial CSS
                normalization and custom fonts.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Professional online magazines:</strong>
                <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/">https://www.zdnet.com/</a>,
                <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/</a>
            </li>
            <li><strong>LinkedIn Group:</strong>
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1836487/">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1836487/</a>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Blog:</strong>
                <a href="https://thehackernews.coma/">https://thehackernews.coma/</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong>
                <p>Text has sufficient contrast against the background to ensure readability.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Text Resizing:</strong>
                <p>The website allows text to be resized without causing layout issues or content overlaps.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Semantic HTML and ARIA labels:</strong>
                <p>Proper HTML tags are used to structure content logically. Headings, lists, and other elements convey
                    the document's structure accurately. ARIA labels are applied occasionally.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
                <p>The website incorporates a responsive design approach, ensuring an optimal user experience across
                    various devices and screen sizes. Special attention is given to mobile devices. I wrote a script
                    that dynamically adjusts image widths to fit smaller screens. This script uses resized images and
                    selects appropriate fall-back images for devices with limited display capabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-Friendly Navigation:</strong>
                <p>The navigation menu is thoughtfully designed for mobile users, employing a collapsible menu structure
                    that allows easy access to various sections without cluttering the screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistent User Interface:</strong>
                <p>The user interface maintains consistency across different devices, making it intuitive for users to
                    transition from desktop to mobile without a learning curve.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Fundamentals:</strong>
                <p>As a non-cybersecurity professional, I learned some foundational concepts of cybersecurity to design
                    a meaningful website. Industry resources provided valuable insights. Please find references below.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Community Management:</strong>
                <p>I learned a small bit about effective online community management strategies, including moderation
                    and conflict resolution techniques. I think this knowledge is essential to creating a safe and
                    productive environment for users.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ARIA Roles and Attributes:</strong>
                <p>I learned about ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes, which allow me to
                    enhance the accessibility of interactive elements, such as dropdown menus and content areas, for
                    users who rely on screen readers.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Utilizing Media Queries and JavaScript:</strong>
                <p>JavaScript in combination with media queries enables the creation of a responsive footer that adjusts
                    its layout and content based on the device width, ensuring a consistent user experience across
                    various screens. Automatic generation of HTML elements such as a footer and featured section
                    enhances the website's adaptability and visual appeal by tailoring content display to the specific
                    characteristics of each user's device.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lavaraged CSS for responsive Design with Media Queries:</strong>
                <p>Employing media queries in CSS, a responsive design is achieved by adjusting styling rules based on
                    the device's width. These queries enable a seamless transition between different layouts.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Relative Measures for Fluidity:</strong>
                <p>Implementing relative units like percentages and em in CSS promotes fluidity and responsiveness. By
                    using relative measures, elements scale proportionally with their parent containers, maintaining a
                    harmonious layout regardless of the device's screen dimensions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main page sliders:</strong>
                <p>Custom JavaScript in combination with CSS was used to create sliders for the subject sections on the
                    main page. It tracks touch and mouse directions and slides accordingly. What I would improve is
                    sliding speed. Also, JS organizations, in terms of code structure, I would want to improve.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ARIA accesability marckup:</strong>
                <p>Even though ARIA labels are used around the website, I would improve that usage further. There are
                    more options available.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Content management:</strong>
                <p>A lot of HTMl code duplication is used around the website. It makes it harder to maintain such a
                    website. If you need to introduce changes, then you have to make multiple file updates. I would
                    prefer some management system to dynamically populate elements with content.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
